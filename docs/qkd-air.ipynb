    "\n",
    "Suppose Alice and bob are going to use polar codes to do Information Reconciliation (IR) for Quantum Key Distribution (QKD). \n",
    "Before starting the IR process, they need to: \n",
    "\n",
    "1. Test the performance of quantum channels, obtain the estimated quantum bit error rate (QBER) $p_{QBER}$;\n",
    "2. Configure the length of sifted KEY $L$, then use $N = 2^{\\lceil \\log_2 L \\rceil}$ as the length of polar codes;\n",
    "3. Setup the efficiency $f$ of IR scheme, which can be calculated by \n",
    "   \n",
    "   $$ f = \\frac{N-K}{H_2(p_{QBER}) \\times L}, $$\n",
    "\n",
    "   where $K$ is the number of information bits of polar codes, $H_2$ is the binary entropy function. \n",
    "   With configured efficiency $f$, Alice and Bob can decide $K$;\n",
    "4. Generate frozen vector for configured parameter $N, K$ and $p_{QBER}$. Specifically, shorten the polar codes to a $(L, K)$ one via the [Bioglio-Gabry-Land (BGL) method](http://arxiv.org/abs/1701.06458). Then froze $L - K$ bits by the reliability of bit channel calculated by the methos proposed in [_How to Construct Polar Codes_](https://doi.org/10.1109/TIT.2013.2272694);\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, at the begining of IR process, let Alice and Bob hold two bit strings as their sifted KEY $K_s^A$ and $K_s^B$, respectively. \n",
    "The IR is then conducted as follows: \n",
    "\n",
    "1. Alice fills the $L$-length bit string $K_s^A$ into the non-frozen positions of an all-zero $N$-length bit string, obtain $\\hat{K}_s^A$; Similarly, Bob use his sifted KEY $K_s^B$ to obtain $\\hat{K}_s^B$;\n",
    "2. Alice feeds $\\hat{K}_s^A$ to the polar encoder. \n",
    "   The polar encoder will apply the polar transformation $G^{\\log_2 N} = T^{\\otimes \\log_2 N}$, return $u_A = \\hat{K}_s^A \\cdot T^{\\otimes \\log_2 N}$, while the shortened bits will remain 0 by the design of the shortening method. \n",
    "   Note that typically there will be bit-reversal operation after the polarization, but here we omit it for simplicity (this only differs from Arikan's original polar codes in the ordering of the code bits), and $T$ is the polarization kernel;\n",
    "3. Alice calculates the CRC tag $T_A = \\mathrm{CRC}\\left( u^A \\right)$, then sents it to Bob via public channel;\n",
    "4. Alice extracts extracts the frozen bits of $u_A$ according to the frozen vector, obtains syndrome bit string $S_A$;\n",
    "5. Alice send $S_A$ through the public channel;\n",
    "6. Bob feeds $\\hat{K}_s^B$ as codeword and syndrome $S_A$ as frozen bits to the polar decoder, corrects the error in $\\hat{K}_s^B$ and obtain $u_B$;\n",
    "7. Bob applies CRC check to $u_B$, and obtains CRC tag $T_B = \\mathrm{CRC}(u_B)$;\n",
    "8. Bob $T_A$ and $T_B$, if they are the same, then Bob publicly announces that the IR process is successful. \n",
    "\n",
    "This one-shot CRC-checked polar codes-based IR scheme has some drawbacks: \n",
    "- **Low flexibility on sifted KEY length $L$**: For different sifted KEY length $L$, Alice and Bob needs lots of experiments or simulation to find a reasonable efficiency, otherwise high failure rate or low secret KEY yield will be observed; \n",
    "- **Dichomotic results**: If the reconciliation process fails, then the sifted KEY will be totally wasted, no other way to reuse the leaked privacy as error syndrome.\n",
    "\n",
    "_Appending Information Reconciliation_ attacks this problem by introducing a multi-stage polar code reconciliation protocol, which is depicted in the following figure in [AIR paper](https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2204.06971). \n",
    "\n",
    "![Figure-1 in AIR Paper](./images/fig_ref_2.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Before the QKD process, Alice and Bob agree with the number of stages of reconciliation, $R_m$, as well as the reconciliation efficiency of each stage. \n",
    "The reconciliation efficiency increases as reconciliation proceeds to the next stage, since the frozen bits is selected by bit-channel reliability, the corresponding set of frozen bits is always contained in the one of the next stage. \n",
    "The reconciliation will stop at any time when reconciliation is judged to be success -- which is checked and announced by Bob via CRC.\n",
    "In the end of $k$-th stage, if the CRC check indicates failure of reconciliation, then Bob will announce this result -- tell Alice by sending the flag $\\sigma = 1$ through the public channel. \n",
    "With $\\sigma = 1$, Alice appends additional syndrome by selecting the bits in $u_A$ of position $\\mathcal{F}_{k+1} \\oplus \\mathcal{F}_{k}$, i.e. the additional frozen bits of next stage, and sending them through public channel. \n",
    "Now Bob can do reconciliation with new error syndrome appended to the one of former stages. \n",
    "\n",
    "AIR can hence have a very low failure rate, as long as the configured efficiency of the last stage is high enough. \n",
    "Also, AIR can avoid the average efficiency to be too large because of the adaptive reconciliation procedure -- most sifted key pairs can be successfully reconciled with a low efficiency. "

    "\n",
    "In proposed protocol, configured QBER $p_{QBER}$ should be decided before the reconciliation phase, empirically. But we have no additional experiment data to obtain this empirical value here. Therefore, strictly speaking, we did not implement a complete QKD protocol. It becomes meaningful to consider the case that $p_{QBER}$ is deviated from the real QBER $p_{real}$, this could happen when only very limited resources are available for estimating $p_{real}$ before the reconciliation phase. \n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose we use sifted keys data collected from experiments of length $L = 105976$ to obtain an estimation $\\hat{p}_{real}$ of $p_{real}$, the $99\\%$ confidence interval (by the normal approximation of binomial distribution or by adopting the Bayesian posterior with $\\text{Beta}(1,1)$ as prior) of $\\hat{p}_{QBER}$ will be contained in interval $[0.0345, 0.0375]$. Then we can test the IR scheme, using polar codes optimized for $p_{QBER} = 0.036 \\pm 0.0015$ (i.e. `q_ber` in codes) and on simulated random samples obeys $p_{real} \\approx 0.035980$ (i.e. `q_ber_stat` in codes). The confidence interval will be larger for less samples. For example, consider $\\hat{p}_{real}$ estimated from $10000$ pairs of bit obeys error rate of $\\hat{p}_{real} = 0.036$. The $95\\%$ confidence interval will be approximately $[0.032, 0.04]$. \n",

    "### Efficiency\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that, in this realization, when the sifted KEYs are shorter than polar codes, the polar codes will be shortened. \n",
